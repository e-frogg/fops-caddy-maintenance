  ```caddy
  localhost {
    maintenance {
      # Path to custom HTML template
      template "/path/to/template.html"
      # List of IPs that can access during maintenance (supports CIDR notation)
      allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 192.168.5.0/22
      # Retry-After header value in seconds (default: 300)
      retry_after 3600
    }
  }
  ```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `template` | Path to custom HTML template | No |
| `allowed_ips` | List of IPs that can access during maintenance (supports CIDR notation) | No |
| `allowed_ips_file` | Path to file containing allowed IPs with comments | No |
| `retry_after` | Retry-After header value in seconds | No |
| `default_enabled` | Enable maintenance mode by default at startup | No |
| `status_file` | Path to file for persisting maintenance status | No |
| `request_retention_mode_timeout` | Time in seconds to retain requests during maintenance | No |
| `htpasswd_file` | Path to htpasswd file for HTTP Basic Authentication | No |
| `auth_realm` | Custom realm name for HTTP Basic Authentication | No |

### IP Access Control with CIDR Support

The `allowed_ips` directive supports both individual IP addresses and CIDR notation for network ranges, with full IPv4 and IPv6 support:

```caddy
maintenance {
  # Individual IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.50 2001:db8::1 ::1
  
  # CIDR network ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
  allowed_ips 192.168.5.0/22 10.0.1.0/24 172.16.0.0/16 2001:db8::/32
  
  # Mixed individual IPs and CIDR ranges
  allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 192.168.5.0/22 10.0.1.0/24 2001:db8::/32
}
```

**CIDR Examples:**
- `192.168.5.0/22` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 192.168.5.0 to 192.168.7.255
- `10.0.1.0/24` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
- `172.16.0.0/16` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.255.255
- `2001:db8::/32` - Allows IPv6 addresses in the 2001:db8::/32 range
- `::/128` - Allows only the IPv6 loopback address (::1)

**Important:** The plugin uses the client's direct IP address (`r.RemoteAddr`) and does not evaluate proxy headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP`. If your server is behind a proxy, you must whitelist the proxy's IP address rather than the original client IPs.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

The plugin supports HTTP Basic Authentication using htpasswd files, providing an additional layer of access control during maintenance mode.

#### Configuration

```caddy
maintenance {
  # Path to htpasswd file
  htpasswd_file /etc/caddy/.htpasswd
  # Custom realm name (optional, defaults to "Maintenance Mode")
  auth_realm "Maintenance Access"
}
```

#### Creating htpasswd Files

The plugin supports bcrypt hashed passwords for security. You can create htpasswd files using standard tools:

**Using htpasswd command (Apache):**
```bash
htpasswd -nbB admin admin
```

#### htpasswd File Format

The htpasswd file supports comments and follows the standard format:

```txt
# Maintenance access users
admin:$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi
user1:$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi
user2:$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi
```

**Supported Hash Types:**
- **bcrypt** (`$2a$`, `$2b$`, `$2y$`) - **Recommended and fully supported**
- Other hash types (MD5, SHA1, etc.) are not supported for security reasons

#### Access Control Priority

When both IP-based access control and HTTP Basic Authentication are configured, the plugin checks access in the following order:

1. **IP-based access** - If the client IP is in the allowed list, access is granted immediately
2. **HTTP Basic Authentication** - If IP access is denied, authentication credentials are checked
3. **Maintenance page** - If both checks fail, the maintenance page is displayed

This allows for flexible access control scenarios:
- Internal users can access via IP whitelist (no authentication required)
- External users can access via authentication credentials
- All other users see the maintenance page

### IP Access Control with CIDR Support

The `allowed_ips` directive supports both individual IP addresses and CIDR notation for network ranges, with full IPv4 and IPv6 support:

```caddy
maintenance {
  # Individual IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.50 2001:db8::1 ::1
  
  # CIDR network ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
  allowed_ips 192.168.5.0/22 10.0.1.0/24 172.16.0.0/16 2001:db8::/32
  
  # Mixed individual IPs and CIDR ranges
  allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 192.168.5.0/22 10.0.1.0/24 2001:db8::/32
}
```

**CIDR Examples:**
- `192.168.5.0/22` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 192.168.5.0 to 192.168.7.255
- `10.0.1.0/24` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
- `172.16.0.0/16` - Allows IPv4 addresses from 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.255.255
- `2001:db8::/32` - Allows IPv6 addresses in the 2001:db8::/32 range
- `::/128` - Allows only the IPv6 loopback address (::1)

**Important:** The plugin uses the client's direct IP address (`r.RemoteAddr`) and does not evaluate proxy headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP`. If your server is behind a proxy, you must whitelist the proxy's IP address rather than the original client IPs.

## Advanced Configuration Examples

### Default Maintenance Mode for Pre-production Environments

```caddy
preprod.example.com {
  maintenance {
    # Enable maintenance by default at startup
    default_enabled true
    # Allow specific IPs to access during maintenance
    allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1

```caddy
example.com {
  maintenance {
    # Persist maintenance status to survive restarts
    status_file /var/lib/caddy/maintenance.json
    # Retry-After header value in seconds
    retry_after 300
    # Allow office network and specific IPs
    allowed_ips 192.168.1.100 192.168.5.0/22 10.0.1.0/24 172.16.0.0/16
  }
}
```

### Website Maintenance Management Made Easy

**Scenario**: 
- Web platform running as a Docker stack
- Caddy serving as the main entry point/reverse proxy
- Need for controlled maintenance periods to deploy new release or perform maintenance tasks

**Solution**:
The maintenance plugin enables seamless maintenance mode activation by:
1. Toggling maintenance mode through a simple API call to Caddy's admin interface
2. Instantly cutting off all incoming traffic (except allowed IPs/networks)
3. Displaying a maintenance page to all users
4. Safely performing required maintenance tasks, deployment, container rebuilds, etc.
5. Restoring service when ready

### Micro Maintenance with requests retention

**Scenario**: 
- Web platform running as a Docker stack
- Caddy serving as the main entry point/reverse proxy
- Need for short maintenance periods to perform quick tasks without service interruption

**Solution**:
1. Toggling maintenance on through API call to Caddy's admin interface with request retention timeout configuration 
2. Caddy instantly retain incoming requests for the predefined period until maintenance mode is disabled or display a maintenance page if timeout is reached
3. Toggling maintenance off through API, the retained requests are released and forwarded to the backend

### Automated Maintenance Based on Critical Services Health

Automatically managing platform availability based on components health status.

**Scenario**: 
- Microservices architecture with critical dependencies
- Essential services like Database or Queue
- Need for automatic response to infrastructure issues
- Prevention of cascading failures

**Solution**:
The maintenance plugin can be integrated with Docker health checks:
1. Docker health checks monitor critical services
2. Custom script watches for health status changes
3. Maintenance mode automatically triggered when critical service fails
4. System remains protected until services are healthy again
