## Real World Use Cases

### Website Maintenance Management Made Easy

Managing maintenance windows for any web platform can be challenging, especially in modern architectures. Here's how this plugin simplifies the process:

**Scenario**: 
- Web platform running as a Docker stack
- Caddy serving as the main entry point/reverse proxy
- Need for controlled maintenance periods to deploy new versions of the application

**Solution**:
The maintenance plugin enables seamless maintenance mode activation by:
1. Toggling maintenance mode through a simple API call to Caddy's admin interface
2. Instantly cutting off all incoming traffic
3. Displaying a maintenance page to all users
4. Safely performing required maintenance tasks, deployment, container rebuilds, etc.
5. Restoring service when ready

**Benefits**:
- Centralized control through Caddy
- No need to modify application code
- Clean customised user experience during maintenance
- SEO friendly interruption
- Perfect for containerized architectures

### Automated Maintenance Based on Critical Services Health

Automatically managing platform availability based on components health status.

**Scenario**: 
- Microservices architecture with critical dependencies
- Essential services like Database or Queue
- Need for automatic response to infrastructure issues
- Prevention of cascading failures

**Solution**:
The maintenance plugin can be integrated with Docker health checks:
1. Docker health checks monitor critical services
2. Custom script watches for health status changes
3. Maintenance mode automatically triggered when critical service fails
4. System remains protected until services are healthy again

**Benefits**:
- Automatic protection of system integrity
- Immediate response to infrastructure issues
- Clear communication to end users
- Prevention of data corruption
- Reduced manual intervention needs
